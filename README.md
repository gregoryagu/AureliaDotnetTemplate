# AureliaDotnetTemplate
This fine repository was created by Maxim Balaganskiy, based off of the SPA Template in Visual Studio for Aurelia.
It is an example of Aurelia with aspnetcore + bootstrap 4, and webpack 4.
A great starting place for a .netCore based project, as the templates from the aurelia repo can be difficult to get working in Visual Studio.
I have updated it to include a sample of using Syncfusion Controls.
